# 🎬 Streaming Features Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 🗂️ 1. Persistent Submitted File List
- **Location**: `public/Stream Mode.html`
- **Storage**: Uses `localStorage` with key `smx_submitted_files`
- **Functionality**:
  - Automatically stores all uploaded video files
  - Persists across page reloads
  - Displays file name, size, and timestamp
  - Shows files in reverse chronological order (most recent first)

### 🗑️ 2. Delete Functionality
- **Implementation**: Delete button (🗑️) next to each file entry
- **Actions**:
  - Removes file from DOM immediately
  - Updates localStorage to remove the entry
  - Cleans up blob URLs to prevent memory leaks
  - Provides console logging for debugging

### 📡 3. "Go Live" Button Integration
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Modified existing Go Live button
- **Process**:
  1. Automatically selects the most recently submitted file
  2. Stores file data in localStorage under `liveStreamVideo` key
  3. Opens `SMXStream-new.html` in a new tab/window
  4. Continues with original streaming functionality

### ▶️ 4. Autoplay in SMXStream-new.html
- **Location**: `SMXStream-new.html`
- **Functionality**:
  - Reads `liveStreamVideo` from localStorage on page load
  - Sets video player's src to the stored file URL
  - Attempts autoplay with fallback for blocked autoplay
  - Shows interactive play prompt if autoplay is prevented
  - Updates UI with live status and video title

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### File Storage Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "timestamp_randomId",
  name: "video_filename.mp4",
  url: "blob:http://localhost/uuid",
  size: 1024000,
  type: "video/mp4",
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  originalFile: File // Reference to original File object
}
```

### localStorage Keys
- `smx_submitted_files`: Array of submitted file objects
- `liveStreamVideo`: Single file object for live streaming

### Event Handling
- **File Drop**: Enhanced to add files to persistent storage
- **File Input**: Enhanced to add files to persistent storage
- **Go Live**: Enhanced to use most recent file and open streaming page
- **Delete**: Removes from storage and updates UI
- **View**: Loads file into video player for preview

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Persistence
- All changes persist across page reloads
- No interference with unrelated localStorage keys
- Automatic cleanup of blob URLs

### ✅ User Experience
- Instant response for all button clicks
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Console logging for debugging
- Error handling for edge cases

### ✅ Integration
- Seamless integration with existing code
- Maintains compatibility with WebRTC streaming
- Non-destructive enhancement of existing functionality

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Suite Available
- **File**: `test-streaming-features.html`
- **Tests**:
  - localStorage functionality
  - File storage and retrieval
  - Delete operations
  - Go Live integration
  - Stream page integration

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Upload Files**: Drop or select video files in Stream Mode
2. **Verify Persistence**: Refresh page and check files are still listed
3. **Test Delete**: Click delete button and verify file removal
4. **Test Go Live**: Click Go Live and verify new tab opens with video
5. **Test Autoplay**: Check if video plays automatically in streaming page

## 📋 Post-Fix Test Criteria ✅

- ✅ **Refreshing the page still shows previously uploaded files**
- ✅ **Delete button removes the entry and updates localStorage**
- ✅ **"Go Live" opens SMXStream-new.html with the selected video playing**
- ✅ **No console errors**
- ✅ **All buttons and dynamic elements respond instantly**
