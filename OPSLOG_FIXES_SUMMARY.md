# OpsLog Fixes Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… SLANT and VIC Fields Display
**Problem:** SLANT input form and Vehicle input form did not populate on the callout bubble after "S:" and "VIC:" labels.

**Solution:** 
- Fixed bubble content generation in `createBubble()` function (lines 1768-1790)
- Fixed bubble content update in `updateBubbleContent()` function (lines 1942-1964)
- Both functions now properly display: `S: ${data.slant || '-'}` and `VIC: ${data.vehicles || '0'}`

### 2. âœ… Target Status Display
**Problem:** Target status dropdown should populate on callout bubble above Mission/Operation.

**Solution:**
- Moved target status display from right panel to above Mission/Operation in left panel
- Added conditional display: only shows if `data.targetStatus` exists
- Styled with appropriate colors (green for ON TARGET, red for OFF TARGET)
- Updated both `createBubble()` and `updateBubbleContent()` functions

### 3. âœ… Lock Form Boxes
**Problem:** Add lock form box on right side of every form field.

**Solution:**
- Added CSS for `.form-group-with-lock` and `.lock-checkbox` classes
- Updated all form fields in main form (lines 952-1108) to include lock checkboxes
- Updated all form fields in edit modal (lines 854-970) to include lock checkboxes
- Implemented `initializeLockFunctionality()` to handle lock/unlock behavior
- Added lock icon (ðŸ”’) when checkbox is checked

### 4. âœ… Drag & Drop Override
**Problem:** When dragging and dropping a callout bubble into the input form, it should override the lock boxes.

**Solution:**
- Modified `handleFormDrop()` function (lines 3235-3270) to temporarily unlock all fields
- Added logic to store original lock states and restore them after population
- Added support for `targetStatus` field in drag & drop
- Drag & drop now populates ALL fields regardless of lock status

### 5. âœ… Form Preservation on Error
**Problem:** Don't clear input forms if error occurs.

**Solution:**
- Modified form submission success/error handling (lines 1528-1580)
- Forms now only clear on successful submission
- Added comment: "DO NOT clear form on error - keep user's input"
- Implemented locked field value preservation using localStorage

### 6. âœ… Remove Unnecessary Buttons
**Problem:** Remove view history and grading system buttons.

**Solution:**
- Removed `viewHistoryBtn` and `gradingBtn` from sidebar navigation (line 897)
- Removed corresponding event handlers and references
- Cleaned up `updateSidebarButtonStates()` function

### 7. âœ… Zulu Time Refresh Button
**Problem:** Add refresh button next to Zulu time field to update to current time.

**Solution:**
- Added refresh button (ðŸ”„) between Zulu time field and lock checkbox
- Created new CSS class `.form-group-with-refresh-and-lock` for proper layout
- Implemented `updateZuluTime()` function to get current time in HHMM format
- Added visual feedback with rotation animation on click
- Respects lock status - won't update if field is locked
- Applied to both main form and edit modal
