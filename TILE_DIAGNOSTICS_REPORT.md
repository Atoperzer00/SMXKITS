can# 🔍 Leaflet.js Tile Loading Diagnostics Report

## 📋 Issue Summary
Your Leaflet.js tactical map is configured to load tiles from `altis/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` but the map photos are not appearing.

## ✅ What I Found Working
1. **Tile Files Exist**: PNG files are present in `/public/altis/` directory structure
2. **Server Configuration**: Express.js server correctly serves static files from `public/` directory
3. **Tile Pattern**: `altis/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` pattern is correctly configured
4. **JavaScript Loading**: All required JS files (Leaflet, jQuery, mapUtils, defaultMap, altis) are loading

## 🚨 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Initial Zoom Level Too High**
**Problem**: Default zoom level was set to 2, which may request tiles that don't exist at startup
**Fix**: Changed default zoom to 1 in `altis.js`

### 2. **Missing Map Bounds**
**Problem**: No bounds defined, causing Leaflet to request tiles outside available range
**Fix**: Added bounds `[[0, 0], [30720, 30720]]` to configuration

### 3. **Tile Wrapping Issues**
**Problem**: Leaflet may try to wrap tiles around the world
**Fix**: Added `noWrap: true` to tile layer options

### 4. **Limited Error Diagnostics**
**Problem**: Original code had basic logging but insufficient for debugging
**Fix**: Created enhanced diagnostic tools

## 🛠️ Files Created/Modified

### New Diagnostic Files:
1. **`Trackpoint-fixed.html`** - Enhanced version with debug panel and better error handling
2. **`test-server-tiles.html`** - Server configuration and tile accessibility test
3. **`test-tile-path.html`** - Simple tile path resolution test
4. **`tile-diagnostics.html`** - Comprehensive tile loading diagnostics

### Modified Files:
1. **`altis.js`** - Added bounds, changed default zoom
2. **`defaultMap.js`** - Added bounds support and noWrap option

## 🔧 How to Test & Debug

### Step 1: Test Server Configuration
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test-server-tiles.html`
- Verifies server is serving static files correctly
- Tests individual tile accessibility
- Shows file sizes and HTTP status codes

### Step 2: Test Enhanced Map
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/Trackpoint-fixed.html`
- Click "Debug Panel" button to see real-time diagnostics
- Watch console for detailed tile loading information
- Verify tiles are loading with success/error counts

### Step 3: Test Simple Tile Paths
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test-tile-path.html`
- Tests different path variations
- Shows which tile URLs work

## 🎯 Expected Results

After applying the fixes, you should see:
1. ✅ Tiles loading successfully in the debug panel
2. ✅ Map displaying with Altis terrain visible
3. ✅ Console showing "Tile loaded" messages instead of errors
4. ✅ Proper zoom/pan functionality

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### If tiles still don't load:

1. **Check tile file structure**:
   ```
   public/altis/
   ├── 0/0/0.png
   ├── 1/0/0.png, 1/0/1.png, 1/1/0.png, 1/1/1.png
   ├── 2/... (4x4 grid)
   └── 6/... (64x64 grid)
   ```

2. **Verify server is running**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   Should show: "Server running on port 5000"

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Look for 404 errors on tile requests
   - Check for CORS errors
   - Verify JavaScript errors

4. **Test direct tile access**:
   Visit: `http://localhost:5000/altis/6/16/9.png`
   Should display a tile image directly

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Use the fixed version**: Replace your current TrackPoint with `Trackpoint-fixed.html`
2. **Monitor the debug panel**: Watch for tile loading success/failure
3. **Adjust zoom levels**: If certain zoom levels don't work, adjust minZoom/maxZoom
4. **Optimize performance**: Once working, you can remove debug logging for production

## 📞 Additional Support

If tiles still don't appear after these fixes:
1. Check the debug panel output
2. Verify the exact tile file structure matches the expected pattern
3. Test with a simple HTTP server to isolate Express.js issues
4. Consider coordinate system transformation adjustments

The enhanced diagnostic tools will provide detailed information about exactly what's failing in the tile loading process.
