## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Setup (One-time)
```bash
# Run setup script
node setup-streaming.js

# Install dependencies  
npm install

# Start streaming infrastructure
./start-streaming.sh  # Linux/Mac
# OR
start-streaming.bat   # Windows
```

### 2. Configure OBS Studio
1. Install OBS WebSocket plugin
2. Enable WebSocket server on port 4455
3. Configure RTMP output (will be set automatically)

### 3. Start Streaming
**Instructor:**
1. Open `Stream Mode.html`
2. Select class from dropdown
3. Click "Connect to OBS Studio"
4. Click "Start Class Stream"

**Students:**
1. Open `SMXStream-new.html?classId=YOUR_CLASS_ID`
2. Stream appears automatically when instructor starts
3. Use rewind controls to go back up to 5 minutes
4. Click "LIVE" button to return to live edge

## 🔗 URLs

- **Instructor Interface:** http://localhost:3000/Stream%20Mode.html
- **Student Interface:** http://localhost:3000/SMXStream-new.html?classId=CLASS_ID
- **HLS Streams:** http://localhost:8888/hls/CLASS_ID.m3u8
- **RTMP Endpoint:** rtmp://localhost:1935/live/CLASS_ID

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

4. **Student-Friendly:** 5-minute rewind buffer with pause/seek controls
5. **Real-Time:** Instant stream start/stop with Socket.IO notifications
6. **Scalable:** Docker-based infrastructure that can handle multiple classes
7. **Secure:** No exposed stream keys, class-based access control

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Test the complete streaming workflow
2. Configure OBS Studio with the provided template
3. Set up production environment with proper SSL/TLS
4. Add authentication for RTMP publishing in production
5. Monitor performance and adjust buffer settings as needed

The migration is complete and ready for testing! 🎬
